## AI Development Assistant Bundle

This PR introduces a comprehensive AI Development Assistant Bundle that provides intelligent code analysis capabilities with robust fallback mechanisms.

### Features

**🔍 Hybrid Code Analysis**
- AI-powered analysis with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini support
- Graceful fallback to static analysis when AI providers are unavailable
- Real security vulnerability detection (SQL injection, sensitive data logging)
- Code quality improvements (SOLID principles, type safety, complexity)

**🛠️ Developer Tools**
- `TestProvidersCommand`: CLI diagnostics for AI provider connectivity
- `AIProviderTester`: Comprehensive API testing and configuration validation
- Professional error categorization with user-friendly guidance

**📊 Real Value Demonstration**
- Working `live-demo.php` script detecting 6 real security issues
- Zero-dependency demonstration requiring no API keys
- Immediate value through static analysis

### Usage Example

```php
use Symfony\AI\DevAssistantBundle\Analyzer\HybridCodeQualityAnalyzer;

// Basic usage - works with or without AI providers configured
$analyzer = $container->get(HybridCodeQualityAnalyzer::class);
$result = $analyzer->analyze($request);

// CLI diagnostics
php bin/console dev-assistant:test-providers
```

### Architecture

- **SOLID Design**: Contract-based interfaces with proper dependency injection
- **Graceful Degradation**: Always provides value even without AI configuration
- **Security First**: Protected API keys, comprehensive input validation
- **Enterprise Ready**: Professional error handling, logging, and metrics

### Testing

The bundle includes comprehensive integration tests and a working demonstration script that validates real-world functionality:

```bash
# Run the live demo
php live-demo.php

# Test API connectivity (requires API keys)
php bin/console dev-assistant:test-providers --provider=openai
```

### Documentation

- Complete setup and configuration guide
- Troubleshooting documentation for common issues
- Code examples and best practices
- CHANGELOG with detailed feature breakdown

### Backward Compatibility

This is a new feature bundle with no breaking changes to existing functionality.
