# Code Quality Analysis Request

## Project Information
- **Type**: {{ project_type }}
- **Analysis Focus**: Code quality, maintainability, and best practices
- **Standards**: PSR-1, PSR-12, Symfony coding standards

## Code to Analyze
{% for file_path, content in files %}
### File: {{ file_path }}
```php
{{ content }}
```

{% endfor %}

# Your Task

Perform a comprehensive code quality analysis covering:

## 1. Code Style & Standards
- PSR-1 (Basic Coding Standard) compliance
- PSR-12 (Extended Coding Style) compliance
- Symfony coding standards adherence
- Naming conventions (classes, methods, variables)
- Documentation and comments quality

## 2. Best Practices Assessment
- Method and class size appropriateness
- Cyclomatic complexity evaluation
- Code duplication detection
- Error handling patterns
- Type declarations and strict typing

## 3. Modern PHP Features Usage
- PHP 8+ features utilization (union types, attributes, etc.)
- Proper use of nullable types and null coalescing
- Arrow functions and match expressions where appropriate
- Readonly properties and constructor promotion

## 4. Maintainability Factors
- Code readability and clarity
- Proper separation of concerns
- Magic number/string elimination
- Configuration externalization

## Analysis Guidelines

1. **Be Precise**: Reference specific line numbers and code snippets
2. **Explain Impact**: Clarify why each issue affects code quality
3. **Provide Solutions**: Give concrete, actionable fix suggestions
4. **Consider Context**: Understand the broader application context
5. **Balance Strictness**: Focus on impactful improvements vs. nitpicking

Focus on improvements that will significantly enhance code maintainability, readability, and reliability.
