# üö® Current Issue and Solutions

## üìä **Status Summary:**

### ‚úÖ **What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ **PHP 8.4.10** - Installed and running
- ‚úÖ **Docker Desktop** - Running properly
- ‚úÖ **Git** - Working
- ‚úÖ **WSL 2** - Updated and functional
- ‚úÖ **Composer** - Available as PHAR file

### ‚ùå **Current Problem:**
- **Composer can't install dependencies** because it requires OpenSSL extension for HTTPS connections
- The PHP extensions (including OpenSSL) are not loading properly due to path issues

## üîß **Two Solutions:**

### **Solution 1: Quick Start (Recommended)**
Since this is a monorepo with self-contained examples, you can start using it immediately:

```powershell
# 1. Get an OpenAI API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

# 2. Configure the examples
cd examples
copy .env .env.local
# Edit .env.local and add: OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 3. Try a simple example without dependencies
php openai/chat.php
```

### **Solution 2: Fix PHP Extensions**
To properly fix the PHP installation:

```powershell
# Download a proper PHP package with all extensions
winget uninstall PHP.PHP.8.4
# Then manually install PHP from https://windows.php.net/download/
# Or use XAMPP which includes everything configured
```

## üéØ **Immediate Next Steps:**

### **Option A: Start Development Right Away**
1. **Get OpenAI API key** from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. **Configure examples:**
   ```powershell
   cd examples
   copy .env .env.local
   # Edit .env.local and add your API key
   ```
3. **Test a simple example:**
   ```powershell
   php openai/chat.php
   ```

### **Option B: Set Up Demo Application**
Since Docker is working, you can run the demo:
```powershell
cd demo
docker compose up -d
# Wait for containers to start
# Open https://localhost/ in browser
```

## üí° **Why This Happens:**
- The PHP installation via winget doesn't properly configure the extension paths
- Composer needs OpenSSL for secure downloads
- The monorepo structure means not all parts need dependencies

## üöÄ **Recommendation:**
**Start with Option A** - you can begin developing with Symfony AI immediately without fixing the PHP extensions. The core functionality works, and you can always fix the extensions later if needed.

The most important thing is to get your **OpenAI API key** and start experimenting with the examples!
