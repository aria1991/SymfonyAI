## Analysis Guidelines

1. **Quantify Impact**: Estimate performance improvement potential
2. **Prioritize Issues**: Focus on changes with highest performance gains
3. **Consider Scale**: Evaluate how issues affect performance under load
4. **Practical Solutions**: Provide implementable optimization strategies
5. **Monitor Trade-offs**: Consider memory vs speed vs complexity trade-offs

Focus on optimizations that will provide measurable performance improvements in production environments.
